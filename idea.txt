You are playing against someone (1 or more people, but only 1v1 for now)

All the sprites are using sprite-stacking, so it looks 3D

The game is turn based combat
During your move you have an option to:
 move (there is some radius of where you can move)
 shoot (idk)
 use something (like power up or healing idk)
